# Rajasthan Police Hackathon - Police Feedback System 

## Overview
The project addresses the challenges of obtaining feedback on police operations using outdated methods and the need for inclusivity. The system incorporates a Bulk SMS Tool, Auto Chatbot, and a Social Media-Like Platform to engage users and collect feedback in real-time.

## Problem Statement üö®üéØ
Traditional feedback methods lack digitization, uniform guest records, and daily follow-up capabilities. With limited manpower and a diverse, digitally less-literate community, the transparency and efficiency of policing efforts are compromised. The Police Feedback System aims to bridge this gap by providing an accessible platform for community members to share their experiences.

## Features üåü
- **Bulk SMS Tool:** Quickly gather comments on experiences (Happy/Not Happy).
- **Auto Chatbot:** Engage users with questions and compile real-time answers.
- **Online Portal:** Record detailed comments for a comprehensive view (Yet to be developed).
- **Social Media-Like Platform:** Allow users to share experiences and tag specific places for easy categorization.

## Usage üöÄ

The React-based application provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the Police Feedback System. Detailed instructions on installation and usage can be found in the project documentation.
